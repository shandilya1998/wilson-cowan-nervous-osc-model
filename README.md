The following are the details of the experiments conducted with the Wilson-Cowan nervous oscillator model
# EXPERIMENT 1
This experiment involves testing the implmented model for a Wilson-Cowan nervous oscillator model consisting of only a single unit of the exitatory and inhibitory neuron pair.
The following are the values of the parameters used to obtain the plot
- a = 5.6
- b = 5.6
- c = 2.4
- d = -2.4
- Tu = 0.2
- Tv = 0.2
- Su = 0.02
- Sv = 0.02
- mu = 1
